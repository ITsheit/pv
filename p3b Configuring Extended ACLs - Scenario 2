Part 1:    Configure, Apply and Verify an Extended Numbered ACL

Configure, apply and verify an ACL to satisfy the following policy:

·         Telnet traffic from devices on the 10.101.117.32/28 network is allowed to devices on the 10.101.117.0/27 networks.

·         ICMP traffic is allowed from any source to any destination

·         All other traffic to 10.101.117.0/27 is blocked.

Step 1:     Configure the extended ACL.
access-list 199 permit tcp 10.101.117.32 0.0.0.15 10.101.117.0 0.0.0.31 eq 22
access-list 199 permit icmp any any

a.     From the appropriate configuration mode on RTA, use the last valid extended access list number to configure the ACL. Use the following steps to construct the first ACL statement:

1)     The last extended list number is 199.

2)     The protocol is TCP.

3)     The source network is 10.101.117.32.

4)     The wildcard can be determined by subtracting 255.255.255.240 from 255.255.255.255.

5)     The destination network is 10.101.117.0.

6)     The wildcard can be determined by subtracting 255.255.255.224 from 255.255.255.255.

7)     The protocol is Telnet.

What is the first ACL statement?

b.     ICMP is allowed, and a second ACL statement is needed. Use the same access list number to permit all ICMP traffic, regardless of the source or destination address.  What is the second ACL statement? (Hint: Use the any keywords)

c.     All other IP traffic is denied, by default.

Step 2:     Apply the extended ACL.

ip access-group 199 out

Step 3:     Verify the extended ACL implementation.

Step 3: Verify the extended ACL implementation.

a. Ping from PCB to all of the other IP addresses in the network.

b. SSH from PCB to SWC. The username is Admin, and the password is Adminpa55

PC> ssh -1 Admin 10.101.117.2

c. Exit the SSH session to SWC.

d. Ping from PCA to all of the other IP addresses in the network. If the pings are unsuccessful, verify the IP addresses before continuing.

c. SSH from PCA to SWC. The access list causes the router to reject the connection.

f. SSH from PCA to SWB. The access list is placed on G0/2 and does not affect this connection. The username is Admin, and the password is Adminpa55.

g. After logging into SWB, do not log out. SSFI to SWC in privileged EXEC mode. SWB ssh -1 Admin 10.101.117.2
